# Toxic-Spans-Detection
This repository contains the dataset and codes implemented for the toxic spans detection project.<br>
The notebooks in this repository are ready to be run in google colab.<br>
The first cell in each notebook clones this repository.<br>
For the last notebook which contains the final preprocessing and model, settings of the google colab notebook sould be changed to run on TPU.<br>
This is done as follows: Edit -> Notebook settings -> TPU (in the hardware accelerator menu)
